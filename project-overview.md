# Project Overview: Isla Agent Platform

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed overview of the `isla-agent-platform` project. It is a Next.js application bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, featuring Supabase for authentication and database services. The primary goal of the application is to provide a landing page with an authentication form, and upon successful login/registration, redirect users to a protected dashboard. The platform implements a multi-tenant architecture where each user belongs to an organization and can manage AI agents within that organization.

## 2. Technologies Used

The project leverages the following core technologies:

*   **Next.js (v15.3.2):** A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
*   **React (v19.0.0):** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript (v5):** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **Tailwind CSS (v4):** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
*   **Supabase:** An open-source Firebase alternative used here for:
    *   User Authentication (`@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`, `@supabase/auth-helpers-react`, `@supabase/ssr`, `@supabase/supabase-js`)
    *   PostgreSQL Database with Row-Level Security (RLS)
*   **Radix UI (Tooltip):** For accessible UI components like tooltips (`@radix-ui/react-tooltip`).
*   **UUID (v9):** For generating unique identifiers for organizations and other entities.
*   **ESLint (v9):** For code linting and maintaining code quality.

## 4. Core Functionality and Implementation Details

### 4.1. Authentication and Organization Management

*   **Supabase Integration:** Authentication is handled via Supabase using the `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` and `@supabase/auth-helpers-react` packages.
    *   Client-side Supabase interactions are managed through `src/lib/supabase-browser.ts`, which initializes `createClientComponentClient`.
    *   Server-side Supabase interactions (in Server Components and API Routes) are managed through `src/lib/supabase-server.ts`, which initializes `createServerComponentClient` using `cookies` from `next/headers`.
*   **OrgProvider Context (`src/context/OrgProvider.tsx`):** Serves as the central state management solution providing:
    *   Authentication state (user, session) using `SessionContextProvider` from `@supabase/auth-helpers-react` and `supabaseBrowser()`.
    *   Organization information for the current user, fetched efficiently using the `current_organization` view.
    *   Loading states for async operations.
    *   Robust error handling with descriptive error messages.
    *   Cleanup mechanisms to prevent memory leaks using the `isMounted` pattern.
    *   Parallel data loading with `Promise.all` for performance optimization.
    *   A `refreshOrg()` method to reload organization data.
*   **Auth Form (`src/components/AuthForm.tsx`):** Provides the UI for users to sign up or log in, using `supabaseBrowser()`.
*   **Organization Creation (`src/components/CreateOrgForm.tsx`):** Allows users to create organizations, using `supabaseBrowser()`.
*   **Organization API (`/api/organizations/route.ts`):** Provides a server-side endpoint for organization creation, using `supabaseServer()`.
*   **Environment Variables:** Supabase URL and Anon Key are stored in `.env.local`:
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### 4.2. Routing and Pages

*   **Landing Page (`src/app/page.tsx`):** Initial page with the `AuthForm`.
*   **Dashboard Layout (`src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`):** Provides the main structure for the dashboard area, including a sidebar navigation menu with links to "Overview" and "Agents". Includes error handling to display content even when errors occur.
*   **Dashboard Overview Page (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`):** Accessible after authentication, displays organization information or prompts for creation. Includes error handling with retry functionality.
*   **Agent Directory Page (`src/app/dashboard/agents/page.tsx`):** A server component that displays a list of agents belonging to the user's organization. It uses `supabaseServer()` for data fetching and `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';` to ensure dynamic rendering due to cookie usage. Includes comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages and recovery options.
*   **Protected Routes (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`):** Restricts access to dashboard routes based on authentication state from `OrgProvider`. Enhanced with error boundary capabilities that provide useful error information to users.

### 4.3. Agent Directory Feature

The Agent Directory allows users to view and manage their AI agents within their organization.
*   **Server-Side Fetching:** Agents are fetched on the server in `src/app/dashboard/agents/page.tsx` using `supabaseServer()` and ordered by `created_at`. The user's organization is determined using the `current_organization` SQL view.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust try/catch blocks with specific error messages for each step (authentication, organization retrieval, agent listing).
*   **Admin Features:** Platform administrators can assign specialized "Operator" agents to organizations via the `AssignOperatorButton` component.
*   **`AgentCard.tsx`:** A reusable component to display individual agent details, including name, type, creation date, and status.
*   **`AgentStatusPill.tsx`:** Displays the agent's status (e.g., "online", "offline") with a colored dot and a tooltip (using `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` which wraps Radix UI Tooltip) showing "Online" or "Offline". The offline status uses a muted gray color.
*   **`EmptyAgents.tsx`:** A component shown when an organization has no agents, providing a call-to-action to create a new agent (linking to `/dashboard/agents/new`).
*   **Styling:** Components are styled using Tailwind CSS for a consistent look and feel.

### 4.4. Database Schema

The application implements a multi-tenant database structure with the following key tables:

*   **`organizations`:** Represents tenant organizations.
    *   `id`: UUID primary key
    *   `name`: Text
    *   `created_at`: Timestamptz
*   **`organization_members`:** Links users to organizations with roles.
    *   `id`: UUID primary key
    *   `org_id`: UUID (foreign key to `organizations.id`)
    *   `user_id`: UUID (foreign key to `auth.users.id`)
    *   `role`: Text (`'owner'`, `'manager'`, `'viewer'`)
    *   `created_at`: Timestamptz
    *   Unique constraint on `(org_id, user_id)`
*   **`agents`:** Represents AI agents within an organization.
    *   `id`: UUID primary key
    *   `org_id`: UUID (foreign key to `organizations.id`)
    *   `name`: Text
    *   `type`: Text (e.g., 'Support', 'Analytics')
    *   `status`: Text (`'online'`, `'offline'`)
    *   `created_at`: Timestamptz
    *   `public_token`: Text (optional, for external access)
*   **`agent_settings`:** Stores configuration for each agent.
    *   `id`: UUID primary key
    *   `agent_id`: UUID (foreign key to `agents.id`)
    *   `settings`: JSONB
    *   `updated_at`: Timestamptz
    *   Unique constraint on `agent_id`
*   **`platform_admins`:** Stores users with platform-wide administrative privileges.
    *   `user_id`: UUID (foreign key to `auth.users.id`)
    *   `added_at`: Timestamptz
*   **`conversations`:** Stores conversations between users and agents.
    *   `id`: UUID primary key
    *   `org_id`: UUID (foreign key to `organizations.id`)
    *   `agent_id`: UUID (foreign key to `agents.id`)
    *   `created_at`: Timestamptz
*   **`messages`:** Stores individual messages within conversations.
    *   `id`: UUID primary key
    *   `conversation_id`: UUID (foreign key to `conversations.id`)
    *   `sender`: Text
    *   `content`: Text
    *   `created_at`: Timestamptz
*   **`conversation_metrics`:** Stores analytics about conversations.
    *   `conversation_id`: UUID (foreign key to `conversations.id`)
    *   `user_messages`: Integer
    *   `assistant_tokens`: Integer
    *   `created_at`: Timestamptz
*   **`knowledge_items`:** Stores knowledge base items for agents.
    *   `id`: UUID primary key
    *   `agent_id`: UUID (foreign key to `agents.id`)
    *   `kind`: Text
    *   `source_url`: Text
    *   `file_path`: Text
    *   `question`: Text
    *   `answer`: Text
    *   `created_at`: Timestamptz

### 4.5. Row-Level Security and Data Access Patterns

The database implements robust Row-Level Security (RLS) to ensure data isolation and security:
*   **Helper Functions:**
    *   `public.is_org_member(org_uuid uuid)`: Checks if the currently authenticated user is a member of the specified organization.
    *   `public.current_user_organization()`: An RPC function that returns the first organization the current user belongs to.
*   **View:**
    *   `public.current_organization`: A view that simplifies querying for the current user's organization, built on top of `current_user_organization()`. This is used by server components and `OrgProvider` for efficient organization data retrieval.
*   **RLS Policies:**
    *   **Organizations:** Users can view organizations they are members of (via `is_org_member`), create new organizations, and update/delete organizations they are members of.
    *   **Organization Members:** Users can manage their own membership records.
    *   **Agents & Agent Settings:** Users can manage agents and their settings only within organizations they are members of (leveraging `is_org_member` on the agent's `org_id`).
    *   **Conversations & Messages:** Users can access conversations and messages only within their organizations.
    *   **Knowledge Items:** Users can access knowledge items only for agents within their organizations.
*   **Performance Index:** An index `idx_org_members_user_org` on `organization_members (user_id, org_id)` improves query performance for membership checks.

### 4.6. Error Handling and Resilience

The application implements comprehensive error handling at multiple levels:

*   **Client-Side Error Handling:**
    *   `OrgProvider` captures and categorizes errors during initialization and data fetching.
    *   Error states are propagated through the context API to be handled appropriately by components.
    *   Non-critical errors (like admin status checks) are gracefully degraded without blocking the UI.
    *   React cleanup patterns (`isMounted` flag) prevent state updates on unmounted components.

*   **Server-Side Error Handling:**
    *   Server components like `agents/page.tsx` implement try/catch blocks with specific error messages.
    *   Error boundaries provide user-friendly fallback UIs instead of crashing the application.
    *   API routes properly handle errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

*   **User Feedback:**
    *   Loading states are clearly communicated with loading skeletons and spinners.
    *   Error messages are user-friendly and include recovery options (retry, navigate home).
    *   Empty states provide clear next steps.

### 4.7. Styling

*   **Tailwind CSS:** Used for styling the application. Global styles are defined in `src/app/globals.css`.
*   **Brand Guidelines:** The application implements a consistent brand identity with:
    *   Custom colors palette with primary blues and teals defined in CSS variables
    *   Gradient text and button effects
    *   Hover animations and transitions
    *   Custom UI elements with branded styling
*   **Custom Fonts:** Uses Plus Jakarta Sans from Google Fonts for a modern, clean typography
*   **UI Components:** All UI components follow a consistent design language with:
    *   Rounded corners (border-radius)
    *   Shadow effects for depth
    *   Hover and focus states for interactive elements
    *   Consistent spacing and layout patterns
*   **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes
*   **PostCSS:** Configured in `postcss.config.mjs`, primarily for processing Tailwind CSS.

### 4.8. Development Scripts

The `package.json` defines the following key scripts:

*   `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `npm run start`: Starts the production server.
*   `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code style issues.

## 8. Next.js 15 Compatibility Updates

The project has been updated to be compatible with Next.js 15, which introduced several breaking changes, particularly around async Server Components and Route Handlers. The following modifications were made to ensure compatibility:

### 8.1. Completed Updates

1. **Client/Server Component Separation**:
   - Converted `AgentLayout` from a server component to a client component, removing server-only imports (`next/headers`, `createServerComponentClient`)
   - Modified the component to receive data as props instead of fetching it directly
   - Updated page components to properly pass agent data to the layout

2. **TypeScript Improvements**:
   - Added proper interfaces for agent types and knowledge items
   - Replaced `any` types with proper type definitions to improve type safety
   - Fixed empty interface warnings in UI components (`input.tsx`, `textarea.tsx`)

3. **Route Handler Updates**:
   - Updated API route handlers to comply with Next.js 15's parameter structure
   - Modified params to be a Promise type in route handlers (e.g., in `/api/agents/[id]/metrics/route.ts`)

4. **JSX and Code Improvements**:
   - Fixed unescaped apostrophes in JSX with proper HTML entities
   - Replaced HTML `<a>` tags with Next.js `<Link>` components
   - Removed unused variables and imports

5. **ESLint and Build Fixes**:
   - Resolved ESLint warnings that were causing build failures
   - Fixed type issues to ensure successful builds

### 8.2. Remaining Issues

1. **Cookie Access Warnings**:
   - There are still warnings about `cookies()` not being awaited: `[Error: Route "/" used 'cookies().get(...)'. 'cookies()' should be awaited before using its value.]`
   - The Supabase server client needs to be updated to use async `cookies()` calls

2. **Supabase Security Warning**:
   - There's a warning about using the user object from `supabase.auth.getSession()`: "Using the user object as returned from supabase.auth.getSession() or from some supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange() events could be insecure!"
   - Need to update to use `supabase.auth.getUser()` instead for improved security

### 8.3. Missing Features and Routes

Several routes mentioned in the navigation are returning 404 errors and need to be implemented:

1. **Agent Configuration Routes**:
   - `/dashboard/agents/[id]/logic` - Agent logic configuration
   - `/dashboard/agents/[id]/theme` - Theme customization for agents
   - `/dashboard/agents/[id]/integrations` - Third-party integrations
   - `/dashboard/agents/[id]/settings` - General agent settings

2. **Monitoring and Analytics Routes**:
   - `/dashboard/agents/[id]/conversations` - Conversation history and management
   - `/dashboard/agents/[id]/analytics` - Usage analytics and statistics

3. **Agent Creation**: 
   - The "New Agent" button links to `/dashboard/agents/new`, but this route is not yet implemented

4. **Missing API Endpoints**:
   - Endpoints for updating agent settings
   - Endpoints for agent CRUD operations
   - Webhook integration endpoints

### 8.4. Development Priorities

Based on the current state, here are the recommended next steps for development:

1. Fix remaining cookie and authentication security issues
2. Implement the core missing routes, starting with:
   - Agent creation
   - Basic settings management
3. Enhance the agent instruction and knowledge management features
4. Add the conversation management functionality
5. Implement analytics and reporting features
6. Add theme customization capabilities

These updates will help complete the agent platform functionality and ensure full compatibility with Next.js 15's features and best practices.
